    "## What is Calibration\n",
    "Calibration is an important process that involves fine-tuning the parameters of a quantum computer to ensure the stability and accuracy of quantum operations. The calibration procedures varies depending on the architecture of the quantum computers, the type of qubits used and the error correction techniques implemented. Generally, Calibration may involve the following\n",
    "- Gate calibration - adjusting and measuring the pulse duration, amplitudes and fidelity of the quantum gates, \n",
    "- Noise Mitigation - identifying and mitigating environmental noise,\n",
    "- Qubit Calibration - measuring and understanding the coherence times of the qubits. The coherence time is a measure of how long a qubit can retain its information."

    "## Why is Calibration Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers, unlike their classical counterparts,  operate on the principles of quantum mechanics, as a result they are highly sensitive to environmental interference ( such as changes in temperature, electromagnectic fields, vibrations) and hardware limitations or imperfections. Calibration ensures that the system is stable and can return accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result from the calibration data provides users with information such as coherence times and fidelity of the gates which allows them to optimize their quantum circuits. Overall, it gives an idea of the current status of Helmi. Here is a brief description of figures received from the calibration data: [Figures-of-merit](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/quantum-computing/helmi/running-on-helmi/#figures-of-merit)."
